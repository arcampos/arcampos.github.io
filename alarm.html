<!--INSTRUCTIONS
Write a program that determines if you can sleep in or not.
Your programshould get all its input from your computer's clock.
On all weekdays (Monday - Friday) that are not holidays, the program should output
"Get up!" On all other days (weekends and holidays) the program should output
"Sleep in." The hlidays the program must check for are January 1, July 4,
and December 25.

Within your program, use this JS code taht will get the current month, current
day of the month, and current day of the week from your computer's clock:

var now = new Date();
var month = now.getMonth();
var dayOfMonth = now.getDate();
var dayOfWeek = now.getDay();

If you use the above code, the variable month will hold 0 if the curent month
is January, 1 if February, and so on to 11 if December. The variable dayOfMonth
will hold 1 for the first day of the month uÂ´to 28, 29, 30 or 31 for the last
day of the month. The variable dayOfWeek will hold 0 if today is Sunday, 1 if
today is Monday, and so on to 6 if today is Saturday.
